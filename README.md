# Alcohol Consumption Analysis

The Alcohol Consumption dataset contains information about the consumption of alcoholic beverages in countries around the world.


Within this project, I am exploring the following:
* How much beer is drunk in Ukraine?
* Which country drinks the most beer?
* Top 5 countries by wine consumption.
* Which countries drink wine the least?
* Find the average drinking rates for each continent.
* Which continent drinks the most beer?
* How much alcohol is consumed in total on each continent?
* Visualize the consumption of beer and wine on different continents (using seaborn and matplotlib).
* Calculate a Pearson correlation coefficient between wine and beer consumption.

# Some conclusions 
* Most alcohol is drunk in Namibia. 
* Top 5 countries by wine consumption are: France, Portugal, Andorra, Switzerland, Denmark. 
* Correlation between wine and beer consumption is average.

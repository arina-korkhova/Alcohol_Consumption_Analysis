## About the Project 

:world_map: I investigated and analyzed the dataset of alcohol consumption across the globe, obtaining interesting insights about different countries. 

:bar_chart: Found the most and least drinking countries.

:books: **Libraries used**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Objective

* :beer: How much beer is drunk in Ukraine?
* :beers: Which country drinks the most beer?
* :wine_glass: Top 5 countries by wine consumption.
* :milk_glass: Which countries drink wine the least?
* :world_map: Find the average drinking rates for each continent.
* :beers: Which continent drinks the most beer?
* :champagne: How much alcohol is consumed in total on each continent?
* :globe_with_meridians: Visualize the consumption of beer and wine on different continents (using seaborn and matplotlib).

* :framed_picture: Calculate a Pearson correlation coefficient between wine and beer consumption.

## Some conclusions 
* :earth_africa: Most alcohol is drunk in Namibia. 
* :classical_building: Top 5 countries by wine consumption are: France, Portugal, Andorra, Switzerland, Denmark.
